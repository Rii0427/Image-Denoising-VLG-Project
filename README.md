Image Denoising

Image denoising is a process used to remove noise from images, making them clearer and improving their quality. Noise in images can come from various sources such as sensor limitations, low-light conditions, or transmission errors. Here are some common techniques used for image denoising:

Filters (Spatial Domain Methods):

Mean filter: Replace each pixel with the average of its neighborhood.
Gaussian filter: Replace each pixel with a weighted average of its neighborhood, where weights are determined by a Gaussian function.
Median filter: Replace each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood.

Wavelet Transform:

Decompose the image into different frequency bands using wavelet transform.
Threshold high-frequency wavelet coefficients to remove noise.
Reconstruct the image from the denoised wavelet coefficients.
Non-Local Means (NLM):

Instead of averaging nearby pixels, NLM averages pixels that have similar neighborhoods.
This method exploits the redundancy in natural images, where similar patches often appear multiple times.

Denoising Autoencoders:

Use deep learning models like autoencoders trained specifically for denoising.
The autoencoder learns to map noisy images to clean images during training.
Deep Learning Models:

CNN-based methods: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained end-to-end for image denoising tasks.
GAN-based methods: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate realistic images from noisy inputs, effectively denoising them in the process.
Patch-Based Methods:

Divide the image into overlapping patches.
Estimate noise in each patch and use this information to denoise the image.

Iterative Methods:

Algorithms like BM3D (Block Matching 3D) denoise images by collaborative filtering in transform domains.
The choice of method depends on factors such as the type and level of noise, computational resources available, and the desired quality of the denoised image. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and researchers often combine multiple approaches for optimal results in different scenarios.

Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. Importing Libraries
We start by importing necessary libraries for file handling, image processing, machine learning, and deep learning.

2. Mounting Google Drive
Google Drive is mounted to access and store data and models.

3. Navigating to the Notebook Directory
We change the current working directory to the directory containing the notebook.

4. Navigating to the Dataset Directory
We navigate to the directory containing the dataset and verify its existence.

5. Defining Paths for HQ and LQ Images
We define and verify the paths for HQ and LQ image directories.

6. Loading Images
We load and pair HQ and LQ images, ensuring an equal number of images in both directories.

7. Loading and Normalizing Image Pairs
We define a function to load and pair images, followed by normalization.

8. Splitting Data
We split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

9. Creating PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader
We define a custom dataset class for handling image pairs and create data loaders for training, validation, and testing.

10. Defining and Initializing the Model
We define a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for denoising and initialize it.

11. Training the Model
We train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.

12. Saving and Loading the Model
We save the trained model and load it for evaluation.

13. Evaluating the Model
We evaluate the model on the test set and calculate the loss.

14. Calculating Performance Metrics
We calculate PSNR and SSIM metrics for the denoised images compared to the original images.
